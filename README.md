# Start of the 2025 Robot Code


The Primary Design Goal will include:

- REV MAX Swerve Base
- One Stage Rev NEO Motor Driven Elevator
- Three Pronged "Trident" Intake With a focus on Algea


## Our Targets are: 

Functional Swerve Drive Base Capable of 
 - Accurate and Fast omnidirectional travel with
 - Minimized Stuttering
 - Smooth Directional Changes
 - Accurate Encoder Positioning
 - Error Recovery/Reset | Calibration
 - Driver Specific Configurations

A working Elevator with
- Preset Desired positions
- End Stop limitations preventing over/under shoot 
- Encoder Positions readouts --Visible to the Driver Via the Driver Station
    - A functioning intake Capable ofSelectively Rotating Forwards and backwards to interact with game pieces 
    - A "loaded" Indicator --> Driver Station


# Autonomous
  - From start postion  ---->  Reef Position [As indicated Via April Tags] 
  - Self Alignment with target algea
  - Self Positioned Elevator [Height & Length] 
  - Intake Status ----> Driver Station
